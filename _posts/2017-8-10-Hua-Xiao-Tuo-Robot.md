 > Findings from this phase
 
 In China, the hospital service is not stratified and Everyone tend to choose large, guaran-
teed public hospitals for medical treatment, resulting in the crowding of patients.
Medical resources are limited in hospital and the medical level is not balanced. It causes the issue that patients’ medical difficulties can not be effectively solved.
## Further research
We came to Xinhua Hospital and observed the general situation in hospital and the living condition of the patients. Meanwhile, we visited 15 people, having deep conversation with them.
We got aware of people’s daily life during hospital stay, the demands of people in different positions and the estrangement during communication.

## Analysis
Patients have both basic needs and emotional needs, and most of those needs should be met with others’ partici- pation. However, because of the limited resources and absence of proper tools, many barriers have appeared. These are the places where we can work.
