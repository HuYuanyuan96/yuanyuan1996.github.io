The design of this stool is a experiment of structure.

The designer separated each foot of the stool into two parts and joint them with different Rungs, forming 3 equal wooden compo- nents. And the acrylic panel is curving in order to lock 3 components together. Foot pad made of nylon also plays the role of fastening of each foot.

Because of the simple attended mode, cus- tomers can assemble or disassemble the stool within a minute.
